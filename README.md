# MeasurementKit iOS demo App 

This is the example MeasurementKit iOS application.

To see how it work you should get a copy of this repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit-app-ios
```
To download and install the measurement-kit library we use [cocoapod](https://cocoapods.org). 

To install cocoapod use 

	$ sudo gem install cocoapods

Then use the command 
	
	pod install


This command will compile measurement-kit and its dependencies and install 
the frameworks inside the Xcode Workspace. 

Then open the xcode workspace (not the xcode project!)  located in `Libight_iOS.xcworkspace` and
click on run to build it.
