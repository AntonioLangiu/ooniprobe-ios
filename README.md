To see how it work you should get a copy of this repository with:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheTorProject/libight-ios
```

Then build the library for iOS with:

```
./build.sh
```

This command will compile measurement-kit and its dependencies and
install them as frameworks inside Libight_iOS/Libight_iOS/Frameworks.

Then open the xcode project located in `Libight_iOS/Libight_iOS.xcodeproj` and
click on run to build it.
